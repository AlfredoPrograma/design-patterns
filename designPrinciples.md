## Design principle #1
*Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.*

Take the parts that vary and **encapsulate them**, so, that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

----------

## Design principle #2
*Program to an interface, not an implementation.*

----------

## Design principle #3
*Favor composition over inheritance.*

**Composition** defines an **"HAS-A"** relationship between different parts of our code; making them easily interchangeable and **encapsulating** variants behaviors.
